# Commit message hook

## The seven rules of a great Git commit message

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line!
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters!
3. Capitalize the subject line!
4. Do not end the subject line with a period!
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line!

   *A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:*

   `If applied, this commit will <your-subject-line-here>`

6. Wrap the body at 72 characters!
7. Use the body to explain what and why (not how!)!
